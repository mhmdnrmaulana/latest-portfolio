          clean, high-performing, and user-centric web applications. My
          expertise is rooted in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I leverage
          modern frameworks to build responsive and intuitive digital
          experiences from the ground up. I'm proudly based in Jakarta,

          allowing us to collectively tackle problems and build remarkable
